No project management methodology is perfect. 

They are all bound to fail in certain circumstances, <b>but that's ok.</b> Delays happen, requirements change, and each methodology has its own way of dealing with these things.

<b>What's not ok</b> is how most of them have a common problem that they don't seem to care to solve: they are hard to master. It takes a long time to implement any methodology and an even longer time to change and adapt the practices that don't work. 

<blockquote>When the inevitable problems happen, blame goes to your team's inability to properly implement the methodology, not the methodology's inability to present itself in an approachable and flexible way.</blockquote>

## The Solution

Turns out we can synthesize the practices from the different schools of project management as individual tools or mindsets with well-defined purposes and results. These practices can then be individually adopted, making implementation easier.

We can also present these practices as individual strategies ("cards") that can be used ("played") together in different combinations. This means team members can use the cards to fine-tune & co-create a way of working that they can commit to.

## The Cards

By clicking the button below, you can download the Project Management Cards: a set of 30 quick-to-adopt mindsets and tools extracted from the different PM methodologies. They're meant for teams that want to rethink or adapt their way of working.

There are even more uses for these cards. If you're interested, I've written all about them in this <a href="https://medium.com/@joaobraq">medium article</a>.

The cards are avaliable under a creative commons license, which means you can make your own cards by downloading the editable version <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bx7a4ezS_IRuRHhFTHpaNkwwYTg">here</a>. If you do so, please consider sharing them with me and with others!
