No project management methodology is perfect. 

They are all bound to fail in certain circumstances, <b>but that's ok.</b> Delays happen, requirements change, and each methodology has its own smart ways of dealing with these things.

<b>What's not ok</b> is how most of them have a common problem that they don't seem to care to solve: they are hard to master. It takes a long time to learn and implement any methodology and an even longer time for your team to be confortable with changing or adapting the methods that don't work. 

<blockquote>When the inevitable problems happen, blame goes to your team's inability to properly implement the methodology, not the methodology's inability to present itself in an approachable and flexible way.</blockquote>

## The Solution

To make things quick to implement, we can synthesize the practices from the different schools of project management as individual tools or mindsets with well-defined purposes and results. These practices can then be slowly and individually introduced, making change easier.

To make sure teams are confortable fine-tuning their way of working, we can present these practices as individual strategies ("cards") that can be used ("played") together in different combinations. Managers and employees can use the cards to co-create a way of working that both sides can commit to. Teams may also pick a few one-time strategies ("backup cards") as the favored way to deal with unexpected problems.

I've written more about these cards and why I made them in this <a href="https://medium.com/@joaobraq">medium article</a>.
